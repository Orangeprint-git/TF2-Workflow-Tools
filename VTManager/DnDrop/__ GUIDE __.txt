	On the first run you must select
	VTFCmd.exe for this to work
	
	after that you can close the
	window and drag files onto it.
	
	the files must be in this
	same folder for it to work
	
	or you can move D&Drop.bat
	anywhere with the .txt dir
	file; or generate a new
	directoey file for VTFCmd.
	
	if you cancel the file-
	selection you have to delete
	the .txt file and try again.
