VTF & VMT gen guide.

Define file names you want to generate in Names.txt
you can remove the file_(number) default entries.

or go to the folder you want to pull file names from-
and run Namegen.bat in that folder to generate a Names.txt list of all the file names in that folder.


edit VMT settings in Setting.txt 
("$basetexture" "vgui\replay\thumbnails\(filename).vtf") gets auto generated to the according VMT files.

Names.txt files must not contain any spaces between or after names.
Settings.txt must always end on an empty line for $basetexture to be generated on right line.
